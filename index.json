Early bilinguals and relatively proficient second-language learners, but not less proficient learners, displayed mode-specific perceptual normalization criteria even in conditions of rapid, random mode switching.

Our findings show that the monolinguals used prosodic information to predict word endings in both tasks, regardless of first-syllable stress (stressed, unstressed) and structure (CV, CVC). In contrast, the beginning learners did not use prosodic information to anticipate word suffixes in any task or condition. Importantly, the advanced learners mirrored the monolinguals, except in words with first-syllable CV structure, but were slower than the monolinguals. Finally, WM was not associated with anticipatory eye movements, though results were inconclusive for offline processing.

Some articles online criticize his pronunciation. I analyzed his realization of “p” and “t” in Praat and find that, while his pronunciation is not perfect, it is pretty good. I don’t believe he commits the “errors” suggested in the article.\n Overview I recently heard the song despacito featuring teen hero Justin Bieber (my wife mentioned to me that he sings in Spanish and my curiosity got the best of me). I distinctly remember being rather impressed by how well he sang in Spanish, so I was surprised when I saw this article pop up in my facebook feed. Basically, J Balvin and Nicky Jam (I have no idea who these guys are) make fun of J Biebs accent. Specifically, they harp on his pronunciation of the title of the song, suggesting the /t/ in the diminutive form of “despacio” (slow) is realized as [ɹ]. In fact, they sing it a few times [des.pa.si.ɹo] (des-pa-see-row, if you aren’t familiar with IPA) and, in jest, claim at one point that he sings ‘dorito’ [ðo.ɹi.ɾo]. You can watch this specific part here:\n   \nNow, this type of non-native pronunciation actually makes a lot of sense, at least I think the ‘dorito’ comment does. In American and Canadian English an intervocalic “t” (and “d”) is usually pronounced as a flap, which in essence corresponds with Spanish “r” in the same position (note: it has to be in the same position, otherwise it would pronounced as a trill). This leads to all kinds of difficulties for learners of Spanish because they have to avoid a phonological process of their native language. For example, a common mispronunciation of the Spanish word “todo” (all) is [to.ɾo], which actually means “toro” (bull). That is, English speakers (mis)pronounce the intervocalic /d/ as a flap, which is most perceptually similar to Spanish “r”. On the other hand, when they try to pronounce “toro”, the “r” is realized as the English rhotic [ɹ].\nThus, if Bieber were pronouncing /ito/ as most native English speakers do, as a flap, it would be perceived as a Spanish “r” (the flap, not the trill). However, there is no real explanation for why he would pronounce it with an English rhotic ([ɹ]) as J Balvin and Nicky Jam claim. I personally did not hear this pronunciation, so I assume they were just teasing the teenage heart throb. Nonetheless, I noticed a lot of comments in the article were also making fun of his pronunciation, so I decided I would take a look in praat to determine if I am going crazy or if the internet is just full of haters. Here is an example of what we will look at:\n Your browser does not support the audio element.   \n The analysis I downloaded the music video from youtube and converted the .mp4 file to .m4a, and then to .wav. In praat I converted the .wav from stereo to mono. Justin sings the chorus as well as some of the verses. I’m just going to look at the chorus because the verses are accompanied by Daddy Yankee and/or Luis Fonsi. Luckily, pretty much every time he says “despacito” in the chorus there is silence, so we can use that for our analysis. I am going to focus on how he pronounces the stop /t/ (though I did get formant frequency measurements for all the vowels… maybe for another post). This only leaves us with about 5 useful tokens, but there are also a good amount of /p/’s that we can compare them with. Here is arguably the best token:\n It’s clear—at least to me—that Justin is not producing an English rhotic where he should be producing [t]. In other words, he is not saying des-pa-see-row. How do I know? Well, if we zoom in on the final /ito/, we notice two things: 1) there is clearly a closure and 2) there is a burst. These are characteristics of a stop consonant. Now, you might be thinking “Yeah, but a flap looks pretty similar in a spectrogram” and you wouldn’t be wrong, but the clear difference here is that after the release there is a short gap before the voicing of the final /o/. This short gap is called voice-onset time (VOT). Stops have VOT; flaps do not. Here is a close up:\n Now a characteristic of English voiceless stops (“p”, “t”, “k”) is that in word initial position they are produced with aspiration and have long-lag VOT, usually around 60 ms. We refer to them with IPA with: [ph, th, kh]. Voiceless stops are different in Spanish, as they are not aspirated and have short-lag VOT, usually from 0 to 25 ms. The “ito” of “despacito” is word internal, thus, in theory, for an English speaker it should not be aspirated because it is normally realized as a flap, though in emphatic speech it could be realized as [th]. Hopefully I have already convinced you that Biebs is not flapping. So our next question is: what kind of VOT do his stops have? If they are short-lag, we can conclude that they are more Spanish-like. If, on the other hand, they are aspirated, then they would be more English-like. So let’s take a look!\nI measured VOT of every p and t every time Justin sings “despacito”. First, let’s load some packages we will need.\nlibrary(lingStuff); library(tidyverse) Now we can load the data and check the structure.\n# Load data bieber_vot \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026quot;./data/despacito.csv\u0026quot;) # Check structure of dataframe bieber_vot %\u0026gt;% select(., prefix, votP, votT) %\u0026gt;% gather(., key = phon, value = vot, -prefix) %\u0026gt;% str(.) ## Classes \u0026#39;tbl_df\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;tbl\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 10 obs. of 3 variables: ## $ prefix: chr \u0026quot;despacito\u0026quot; \u0026quot;despacito1\u0026quot; \u0026quot;despacito2\u0026quot; \u0026quot;despacito3\u0026quot; ... ## $ phon : chr \u0026quot;votP\u0026quot; \u0026quot;votP\u0026quot; \u0026quot;votP\u0026quot; \u0026quot;votP\u0026quot; ... ## $ vot : num 23.3 19.2 19 19.4 15.6 ... Looks good. Let’s plot the VOT of the p’s and t’s and see how they look. I’ve set the x-limit to range from 0 to 60.\n# Plot vot as a function of phon bieber_vot %\u0026gt;% select(., prefix, votP, votT) %\u0026gt;% gather(., key = phon, value = vot, -prefix) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(., aes(x = phon, y = vot, color = phon)) + stat_summary(fun.data = \u0026#39;mean_cl_boot\u0026#39;, geom = \u0026#39;pointrange\u0026#39;, size = 1.1) + stat_summary(fun.y = \u0026#39;mean\u0026#39;, geom = \u0026#39;point\u0026#39;, color = \u0026#39;darkred\u0026#39;, size = 2.75) + ylim(0, 60) + ylab(\u0026quot;VOT (ms)\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) + scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\u0026#39;/p/\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;/t/\u0026#39;)) + coord_flip() + scale_color_brewer(name = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, guide = F) + theme_dark(base_size = 22, base_family = \u0026quot;Times\u0026quot;) Recall that an English-like VOT would be around 60 ms (but could range from around 40 to over 100!). We can see that the p’s have a VOT of approximately 20 ms (19.29 ms +/- 2.72 sd, to be exact), and the t’s have a VOT of around 25 ms (23.1 ms +/- 7.39 sd). Both are certainly within range of native Spanish pronunciations.\nInterim conclusion: the internet is full of haters.\n\n Not so fast… There is one last thing to keep in mind before we give JBiebs a pass on his Spanish and it’s an important one. Spanish /t/ and English /t/ are articulated at different places in the mouth. Specifically, Spanish /t/ is dental and English /t/ is alveolar. What this means is that when an English speaker pronounces a word with a “t” in Spanish, like ‘despacito’, she also needs to change the place of articulation, i.e. the tongue needs to make contact with the back of the top teeth, and not the hard ridge right above them. When we looked at VOT in the present analysis we didn’t take this difference into account. My personal opinion is that el señorito does a pretty good job, but if you listen closely to the very last ‘despacito’ in the song, it does sound rather alveolar, i.e. gringo-y.\nConclusion: the internet is full of haters.\nblue { color: #0000CC; font-weight: normal; font-size: 20px; } grey { color: #515151; font-size: 22px; font-weight: normal; } .video-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 50%; padding-top: 35px; height: 0; overflow: hidden; width: 70%; } .video-container iframe { position: center; top:0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }   ","date":1494900794,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1494900794,"objectID":"b47d53bd413495f2cbaa47cd3d2068c8","permalink":"http://jvcasillas.github.io/post/2017-05-15_analysis_of_justin_bieber_singing_in_spanish_-_despacito/","publishdate":"2017-05-15T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2017-05-15_analysis_of_justin_bieber_singing_in_spanish_-_despacito/","section":"post","summary":"TL; DR  In the remixed version of the song “despacito”, Justin Bieber sings in Spanish.

The participants provided data in three tasks: one production and two perceptual. The study finds that both learner groups differ from native controls in their production and perception of the /æ/–/ɑ/ contrast.

It is particularly useful because you can embed the form in a webpage, link the results with a spreadsheet and publish the results online. This post shows how to scrape the data from the spreadsheet (google form) in r using the package RCurl. You should be able to follow along by copying and pasting the code into an R session.\nIdeally you can use this method once you have collected data using a google form. For our purposes I just created a google sheet and I will scrape the data from there.\nGet some data To show how this works, I simulated some data with the following code:\n# create fake data # to save in google sheet set.seed(1) df \u0026lt;- data.frame( subj = 1:30, group = gl(2, 15, labels = c(\u0026quot;mono\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;bi\u0026quot;)), score = c(rnorm(15, 87, 8), rnorm(15, 94, 3)) ) I then copy and pasted the data frame into a google sheet. To do this, open google drive and create a new sheet.\nOnce you have some data in a sheet you need to do a few things before you are ready to fire up R.\nFirst, you need to publish your sheet to the web (File \u0026gt; Publish to the web…):\nPublish the sheet and copy the public link from the window.\nAs you can see, my link is:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AqS_DAThPUJuS2L2E-S5X7fM1kpIdhXQdBDZUyt-bWM/pubhtml Copy your link and save it somewhere. We will need it in just a second.\nNow we’re ready for R. Here are the packages I used:\n# load libraries library(dplyr); library(tidyr); library(RCurl) library(ggplot2); library(DT); library(pander)  Scrape We will use the RCurl package to scrape the data. The command we need is getForm(). The first arguement represents the URI to which the form is posted. You can just use the one shown below for a google sheet. The important part here is the key arguement. You need to copy it from the link you saved above. The key can be found in the last part of the link. Here is my link again:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AqS_DAThPUJuS2L2E-S5X7fM1kpIdhXQdBDZUyt-bWM/pubhtml Specifically we want:\n1AqS_DAThPUJuS2L2E-S5X7fM1kpIdhXQdBDZUyt-bWM Therefore we can delete https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/ from the beginning, as well as /pubhtml from the end. Check the key arguement below. Finally, we use the read.csv() command to import the data.\n# scrape data sheet = getForm(\u0026quot;https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub\u0026quot;, hl =\u0026quot;en_US\u0026quot;, key = \u0026quot;1AqS_DAThPUJuS2L2E-S5X7fM1kpIdhXQdBDZUyt-bWM\u0026quot;, output = \u0026quot;csv\u0026quot;, .opts = list(followlocation = TRUE, verbose = TRUE, ssl.verifypeer = FALSE)) df \u0026lt;- read.csv(textConnection(sheet)) Let’s see if it worked…\npandoc.table(df, style = \u0026quot;rmarkdown\u0026quot;, round = 2)   subj group score    1 mono 81.99  2 mono 88.47  3 mono 80.31  4 mono 99.76  5 mono 89.64  6 mono 80.44  7 mono 90.9  8 mono 92.91  9 mono 91.61  10 mono 84.56  11 mono 99.09  12 mono 90.12  13 mono 82.03  14 mono 69.28  15 mono 96  16 bi 93.87  17 bi 93.95  18 bi 96.83  19 bi 96.46  20 bi 95.78  21 bi 96.76  22 bi 96.35  23 bi 94.22  24 bi 88.03  25 bi 95.86  26 bi 93.83  27 bi 93.53  28 bi 89.59  29 bi 92.57  30 bi 95.25    Looks good.

New researchers are often confronted with an unfortunate surprise when it comes time to perform some kind of analysis on their data: they don’t know how, or even where to start. This can be a problem for something trivial, like obtaining simple descriptive statistics, or something much more complex, like fitting models, creating plots and making predictions. When we conduct experiments we don’t usually begin by thinking about how we will analyze our data, and in many academic programs this is not explicitly taught to new students. For most people, especially beginners, the data analysis issue arises later on in the process, usually after the data have already been collected (although I think this ultimately changes with experience).\nIn light of all of this, I think that something handy to learn and evaluate early on is how data analysis typically flows: from obtaining data to obtaining new insight from the data. This is the data analysis pipeline, which usually looks something like this:\nIn essence, the process is simple. After collecting your data, you need to tidy it (step 2) so that it can be loaded and analyzed by your statistical software. After tidying your data, you usually have to transform it (step 3) in some way (also called data preprocessing). This can be occur via the creation of new variables, combining variables, sub-setting variables, etc. Once you have transformed your data, it’s time to visualize it (step 4a) via graphs/plots, and, finally, analyze it. The visualization and analysis steps are often iterative: you might notice something in a graph that leads you to a new analysis, or some kind of insight that requires more data transformation and a new analysis, and so on and so forth until you have obtained new insight and are able to answer your research question(s).\nSo, at the heart of data analysis is tidy data. Most new researchers don’t know what it means to tidy and transform their data, nor that it is probably the most important part of any data analysis. Basically, if your data are not formatted in a way in which they can be easily analyzed (via excel, SPSS, R, etc.), then you can’t do anything with them.\nIn order to facilitate the data analysis pipeline, it is crucial to have tidy data. What this means is that every column in your data frame represents a variable and every row represents an observation. This is also referred to as long format (as opposed to wide format). Most statistical software requires your data to be in long format, with few exceptions (i.e. repeated measures ANOVA in SPSS).\nIn what follows, I take you through three packages that have been created in order to facilitate the data analysis pipeline in R. Each package was created by Hadley Wickham with steps 2, 3, and 4a of the pipeline in mind. Thus we can associate each package with the corresponding step:\n tidyr dplyr basic plotting in r / ggvis  (coming soon)\n ","date":1432001594,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1432001594,"objectID":"5e9668527d98e1ef9d9a98be003eee44","permalink":"http://jvcasillas.github.io/post/2015-05-18_data_pipelines/","publishdate":"2015-05-18T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2015-05-18_data_pipelines/","section":"post","summary":"Overview So you thought up a clever experiment, got IRB approval, recruited participants and collected data… now what?

I’m assuming that you have already installed tikz. If not, see part I in this series. Moreover, this tutorial assumes that you have set up your project in the same way outlined in part II. An added benefit to this approach is that it allows you to insert IPA symbols into the plot via the tipa package.\nThe LaTeX file Ok. You should start with a LaTeX file that looks like this:\n\\documentclass{article} \\usepackage{tikz} \\usepackage{tipa} \\begin{document} \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;= require(tikzDevice) tikz(\u0026#39;plot.tex\u0026#39;, standAlone=TRUE) library(stats) plot(cars) lines(lowess(cars)) dev.off() @ \\end{document} If you have experience working with LaTeX, the preamble should be pretty straightforward (If you need a quick primer on LaTeX, see this tutorial). The important part so far is that you have to include \\usepackage{tikz} and \\usepackage{tipa} before \\begin{document}.\n The R code In knitr, R code goes between \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;= and ends with @. So all of this is R code:\nrequire(tikzDevice) tikz(\u0026#39;plots/cars-plot.tex\u0026#39;, standAlone=TRUE) library(stats) plot(cars) lines(lowess(cars)) dev.off() The command require(tikzDevice) loads tikz into the R workspace. Then, tikz('plots/cars-plot.tex', standAlone=TRUE) calls the tikz device and creates the file cars-plot.tex in the folder plots. It is important to set standAlone to TRUE if you want to have a separate .tex file (this is what allows us to keep the fonts the same as the rest of the document). From this point on until the call dev.off(), we enter what we want to appear in our .tex file. In this case I have plotted the typical cars data from the library stats. Here is the PDF output produced when cars-plot.tex is compiled. Notice the font is different from what you typical get in R.\nNow let’s try something a little more involved and add some IPA. I will use a fake dataset and load it into R.\nmy_data \u0026lt;- read.delim(\u0026quot;assets/my_data.txt\u0026quot;) We will use ggplot2 for this graph.\nlibrary(ggplot2) Now we will call tikz device.\nrequire(tikzDevice) options(tikzLatexPackages = c(getOption(\u0026quot;tikzLatexPackages\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;\\\\usepackage{tipa}\u0026quot;)) tikz(\u0026#39;plots/ipa_plot.tex\u0026#39;, standAlone=TRUE, width=10, height=6) my_data$group \u0026lt;- factor(my_data$group, levels = c(\u0026quot;EL\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;NE\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;LL\u0026quot;)) df\u0026lt;-with(my_data, aggregate(fpro, list(group=group, fstim=fstim), mean)) df$se\u0026lt;-with(my_data, aggregate(fpro, list(group=group, fstim=fstim), function(x) sd(x)/sqrt(10)))[,3] gp \u0026lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x=fstim, y=x, colour=group, ymin=x-se, ymax=x+se)) gp + geom_line(aes(linetype=group), size = .5) + geom_point(aes(shape=group)) + geom_ribbon(alpha = 0.15, linetype=0) + ylim(0, 1) + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 10, by=1)) + labs(list(title = \u0026quot;[\\\\textesh ip/\\\\textesh\\\\textsci p]\u0026quot;, x = \u0026quot;Stimuli\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;\\\\% [\\\\textesh\\\\textsci p]\u0026quot;)) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.background = element_rect(colour = \u0026#39;grey50\u0026#39;, fill = \u0026#39;grey97\u0026#39;, size = .75, linetype=\u0026#39;solid\u0026#39;)) + scale_linetype_discrete(\u0026quot;Group\u0026quot;) + scale_shape_discrete(\u0026quot;Group\u0026quot;) + scale_colour_discrete(\u0026quot;Group\u0026quot;) dev.off() Notice that after the require(tikzDevice) call, we included\noptions(tikzLatexPackages = c(getOption(\u0026quot;tikzLatexPackages\u0026quot;), \u0026quot;\\\\usepackage{tipa}\u0026quot;))  The key component here is \\\\usepackage{tipa}. This means that tipa will be included in the .tex produced from the code, which, in turn, means that we can include IPA sybold in the plot before it is produced. The tikz('plots/ipa_plot.tex', standAlone=TRUE, width=5, height=5) call creates ipa_plot.tex in the folder plots. The rest of the code (up to dev.off()) is the actual plot. Notice that we have included ipa in the following command:\nlabs(list(title = \u0026quot;[\\\\textesh ip/\\\\textesh\\\\textsci p]\u0026quot;, x = \u0026quot;Stimuli\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;\\\\% [\\\\textesh\\\\textsci p]\u0026quot;)) This is the plot that is produced when the resulting .tex file is compiled:\nAnd that’s it.

It explains the file structure necessary to successfully include tikzDevice plots into your LaTeX document. You must first have tikzDevice installed. If you don’t, see part I for more information.\n The structure A simple yet effective way to do reproducible research is to use R (for statistical analysis) directly in a LaTeX environment. There are two ways to accomplish this: (1) Sweave and (2) knitr. Knitr seems to be the better choice, as it builds on some of the deficiencies of Sweave, and is what I am currently using in my workflow. In order to successfully “knit” R code into a .tex format we must use a no-web (.nw) file to create the .tex file. There are two types of no-web files: .Rnw and .Snw. I am not completely sure what the differences are between then, but I use .Rnw and that is what I will mention in this tutorial.\nThe first step is to create a project folder. For the purposes of this tutorial let’s call this folder “master”. Next, we will need some data and some R code that analyzes it. The most common, no-hassle way to accomplish this in R is to save your R code in a separate .R file. For this tutorial, we will call our data “my-data.txt” and our R code “example.R”. The fake data we are going to analyze is for a two-alternative forced choice identification experiment. So, our fake data is in the “my-data.txt” file and the R code that analyzes it is in the example.R file.\nThe next step is to create the “no web” .Rnw file. This is as simple as creating a document in your text editor of choice (I use TextMate 2 and Sublime Text 3) and saving it with a .Rnw extension. For this tutorial we will call this file “example.Rnw”. Its purpose is to call the R code written in “example.R” (which uses the fake data in “my-data.txt”) in order to produce a .tex file (in this case “example.tex”). Still with me? Good.\nNext we need to prepare where we are going to keep the plots produced by tikzDevice. I find it most convenient to have a specific folder, “plots_folder”, where I only keep the tikzDevice plots. So, create this folder inside the “master” folder. TikzDevice creates the R plots and converts them to a LaTeX format (the benefits of this are further explained in part III of this tutorial), saves them in “plots_folder” and we will then include them in the example.tex file which can be compiled into a PDF.

The present study uses meta-analytic techniques and coronal stop data from early bilinguals in order to assess this claim. The goal was to evaluate the cumulative evidence for “compromise” voice-onset time (VOT) in the speech of early bilinguals by providing a comprehensive assessment of the literature and presenting an acoustic analysis of coronal stops from early Spanish–English bilinguals. The studies were coded for linguistic and methodological features, as well as effect sizes, and then analyzed using a cross-classified Bayesian meta-analysis. The pooled effect for “compromise” VOT was negligible (β = −0.13). The acoustic analysis of the coronal stop data showed that the early Spanish–English bilinguals often produced Spanish and English targets with mismatched features from their other language. These performance mismatches presumably occurred as a result of interlingual interactions elicited by the experimental task. Taken together, the results suggest that early bilinguals do not have “compromise” VOT, though their speech involves dynamic phonetic interactions that can surface as performance mismatches during speech production.  @Article{casillas_perfomance_mismatches_2021, author = {Joseph Vicent Casillas}, title = {Interlingual Interactions Elicit Performance Mismatches Not {\u0026#39;Compromise\u0026#39;} Categories in Early Bilinguals: {E}vidence from Meta-Analysis and Coronal Stops}, year = {2021}, journal = {Languages}, volume = {6}, number = {9}, pages = {1--20}, doi = {https://doi.org/10.3390/languages6010009}, }   Casillas, J.

The aim was to analyze the longitudinal development of Spanish stop voicing contrasts in an immersion learning context. Native English‐speaking late learners of Spanish provided production data for Spanish stops on a weekly basis throughout a domestic immersion program. The data were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel models and generalized additive mixed models. The analyses revealed phonetic learning in voiced stops over the course of the immersion program, though learners’ production was inconsistent and did not fall within native ranges for most stop segments. The results suggest that L2 phonetic category formation can occur at an early stage of development and follows a nonlinear trajectory that is subject to individual and segment‐specific variability. Furthermore, L2 phonetic representations are unstable during the early stages of learning.  @Article{CasillasProdStops_ll2020, author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas}, title = {The longitudinal development of fine-phonetic detail: {S}top production in a domestic immersion program}, year = {2020}, journal = {Language Learning}, doi = {https://doi.org/10.1111/lang.12392}, volume = {70}, number = {3}, pages = {768--806}, }   Casillas, J.

This study focuses on the role of language use during the initial stages of development of phonetic categories related to stop voicing and analyzes the relationship between production and perception. Native English-speaking late learners of Spanish provided production/perception data on a weekly basis throughout the course of a seven-week immersion program in which L1 use was prohibited. The production/perception data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed effects models. Generalized additive mixed models were used to analyze and compare the learning trajectories of each modality. The analyses revealed phonetic learning in both production and perception over the course of the program. Perception gains paralleled those of native bilinguals by the conclusion of the program and preceded production gains. This study is novel in that it provides production/perception data in a semi-longitudinal design. Moreover, the beginning adult learners are examined in a learning context in which L1 use was minimal and L2 input was maximized. Taken together, the experiments suggest that L2 phonetic category formation can occur abruptly, at an early stage of development, is perceptually driven, and appears to be particularly fragile during the initial stages of learning.  @Article{CasillasProdPercStops, author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas}, title = {Phonetic category formation is perceptually driven during the early stages of adult {L}2 development}, journal = {Language and Speech}, year = {2020}, doi = {https://doi.org/10.1177/0023830919866225}, volume = {63}, number = {3}, pages = {550--581}, }   Casillas, J.

Native English speaking learners of Spanish and bilinguals provided production data that were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel models. The analyses included a pre/post program evaluation of stop voicing in a delayed shadowing task, as well as a comparison with the participants’ post-program production in a task that required semantic processing. The analyses revealed phonetic learning for stop voicing over the course of the program, though production gains diminished when the task required semantic processing.

In Experiment 1, simultaneous Spanish-English bilinguals and beginner second-language learners of Spanish labeled the same acoustic continuum in two experimental sessions (Spanish mode, English mode), and both groups were found to display language-specific perceptual boundaries (or session effects). In Experiment 2, early bilinguals and late second-language learners of various levels of proficiency participated in a single session in which, in random order, they labeled nonwords that were designed to prime either Spanish or English language modes. Early bilinguals and relatively proficient second-language learners, but not less proficient learners, displayed mode-specific perceptual normalization criteria even in conditions of rapid, random mode switching. Along with similar ones, the experiments reported here demonstrate that bilinguals are able to exploit language-specific perceptual processes (or norms) when processing speech sounds, which entails some degree of separation between their sound systems.  @Article{CasillasSimonet_jphon2018, author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas and Miquel Simonet}, journal = {Journal of Phonetics}, title = {{Perceptual categorization and bilingual language modes: Assessing the double phonemic boundary in early and late bilinguals}}, volume = {71}, year = {2018}, pages = {51--64}, doi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2018.07.002}, }   Sagarra, N. and J.

Our findings show that the monolinguals used prosodic information to predict word endings in both tasks, regardless of first-syllable stress (stressed, unstressed) and structure (CV, CVC). In contrast, the beginning learners did not use prosodic information to anticipate word suffixes in any task or condition. Importantly, the advanced learners mirrored the monolinguals, except in words with first-syllable CV structure, but were slower than the monolinguals. Finally, WM was not associated with anticipatory eye movements, though results were inconclusive for offline processing. Taken together, the present study shows that suprasegmental information facilitates morphological anticipation during spoken word recognition, and that adult learners can gain anticipatory processing patterns qualitatively, but not quantitatively, similar to monolinguals.  @Article{SagarraCasillas_JSLS2018, author = {Nuria Sagarra and Joseph Vincent Casillas}, journal = {Journal of Second Language Studies}, title = {Suprasegmental information cues morphological anticipation during {L1/L2} lexical access}, volume = {1}, number = {1}, year = {2018}, pages = {31--59}, doi = {https://doi.org/10.1075/jsls.17026.sag}, }   Bessett, R.

When unambiguous stimuli are used instead, selective adaptation (SA) effects have been reported, even after few adaptor presentations. Crucially, selective adaptation by an ambiguous sound in biasing lexical contexts had previously been found only after massive adaptor repetition [Samuel (2001). Psychol. Sci. 12(4), 348–351]. The present study shows that extensive exposure is not necessary for lexically driven selective adaptation to occur. Lexically driven selective adaptation can arise after as few as nine adaptor presentations.

Two learner groups are examined: (1) early, proficient English speakers who were raised by Spanish-speaking families but who became dominant in English during childhood and, as adults, lack communicative abilities in Spanish, and (2) Spanish-speaking late learners of English who continue to be dominant in Spanish.

The study finds that both learner groups differ from native controls in their production and perception of the /æ/–/ɑ/ contrast.

The first experiment revealed that the early learners produced the contrast in a native-like manner in terms of the spectral envelope and duration use. The second experiment found that early learners differed from both control groups in how they categorized the /i/-/ɪ/ continua based on spectrum and duration, and the extent to which they rely on these two cues. The effects of linguistic experience on L2 phonetic behavior are discussed.  @Article{CasillasPhonetica2015, author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas}, title = {Production and perception of the /i/-/\u0026amp;#618;/ vowel contrast: The case of L2-dominant early learners of English}, journal = {Phonetica}, volume = {72}, number = {2-3}, pages = {182-205}, year = {2015}, doi = {https://doi.org/10.1159/000431101}, }   Casillas, J.

English and Spanish coronal stops are hypothesized to differ in terms of voice-onset time and place of articulation. We are particularly concerned with capturing the place of articulation difference with acoustic data, as the voice-onset time difference is well known. Specifically, we focus on English /d/ and Spanish /t/, which are phonetically-voiceless stops with a short-lag voice-onset time. Spanish /t/ has been described as being articulated at dental place, whereas English /d/ is articulated at alveolar place. Mixed-effects models explored various spectral measurements of the consonant burst and found that standard deviation, relative burst intensity, and center of gravity differed as a function of place of articulation (or language).  @InProceedings{CasillasDiazSimonetICPhS2015article, author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas and Yamile D\u0026amp;iacute;az and Miquel Simonet}, editor = {The Scottish Consortium {for ICPhS 2015}}, organization = {Proceedings of the 18th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences}, publisher = {University of Glasgow: Glasgow. http://www.icphs2015.info, ISSN: 241-0669}, title = {Acoustics of Spanish and English coronal stops}, booktitle = {ICPhS 18}, pages = {1-5}, year = {2015}, }   Simonet, M., J.

Crucially, the effects of lexical stress (stressed, unstressed syllable) on VOT are analyzed. The study investigates aspirated stops (English /t/), short-lag voiceless stops (English /d/, Spanish /t/) and pre-voiced stops (Spanish /d/). Three groups of speakers provide data: English monolinguals, Spanish monolinguals, and proficient Spanish-English bilinguals. The study finds that lexical stress lengthens aspiration (English /t/) and prevoicing (Spanish /d/) but it does not alter significantly short-lag stops (Spanish /t/, English /d/). Monolinguals and bilinguals differ slightly in their phonetic behavior. Implications for gestural coordination as well as for feature theory are discussed.  @InProceedings{SimonetCasillasDiazSP72014article, author = {Miquel Simonet and Joseph Vincent Casillas and Yamile D\u0026amp;iacute;az}, editor = {N Campbell and D Gibbon and D Hirst}, organization = {Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Speech Prosody: Social and Linguistic Speech Prosody}, publisher = {Trinity College, Dublin. speechprosody2014.org, ISSN: 2333-2042}, title = {The effects of stress/accent on VOT depend on language ({E}nglish, {S}panish), consonant (/d/, /t/) and linguistic experience (monolinguals, bilinguals)}, booktitle = {Speech Prosody 7}, pages = {202-206}, year = {2014}, }   Casillas, J.

Concretamente, se investiga el efecto que tiene la realización del africado prepalatal sordo y su variante fricativa no estándar sobre las percepciones de credibilidad de 4 candidatos a un puesto de trabajo hipotético. Un cuestionario basado en los índices de credibilidad utilizados por McCroskey (1999) se distribuyó a 111 participantes para medir sus actitudes hacia los 4 candidatos. El experimento consistió en una variación de la técnica matched-guise para asignar a los participantes a uno de dos grupos, el primero escuchó la variante estándar y el segundo la variante fricativa. Se demuestra que la variante fricativa recibe valoraciones de credibilidad más bajas que la variante estándar.  @InProceedings{CasillasWSS62013article, author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas}, editor = {Ana M.

El refrán ha tenido y sigue teniendo suma importancia a la hora de conocer y entender la cultura hispana, ya sea oral o en textos escritos. Es algo que los estudiantes de español como segunda lengua pueden comprobar puesto que supone un reto en su aprendizaje. Como es bien sabido, El Quijote, novela estudiada exhaustivamente desde que fue publicada por primera vez, es una fuente paremiológica imprescindible para quien quiera aprender, investigar o simplemente gozar del refranero cervantino. En palabras de Tarnovska: “No hay otra obra literaria que sea ni pueda ser considerada refranero popular de la misma importancia que El Quijote” (287). Además de ser una de las obras de literatura más esenciales de todos los tiempos, también es un recurso, una vía por medio de la cual el lector puede acercarse a la cultura española.  @Article{Casillas2009gaceta, author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas}, issn = {1886-1741}, journal = {La Gaceta Hisp\u0026amp;aacute;nica de Madrid}, title = {El uso de los refranes en El Quijote}, volume = {VIII}, year = {2009}, }   Submitted Jiménez-Crespo, M. and J.
